# Minimax-BRG

This is a repository for the paper named "Verification of Nonblockingness in Bounded Petri Nets: A Novel Semi-Structural Approach".

Please see the PDF file named "Test_MinimaxBRG.pdf" for three additional benchmarks corresponding to the paper.

# Please see MinimaxBRG_Code directory for the codes of the paper.

This program requires Matlab R2017a or higher version.

We implement the key idea of the paper in MinimaxBRG.m (for computing the minimax-BRGs), MinimaxMbasis.m (for comptuting the minimax basis markings), and minimaxy.m (for computing the minimal and maximal explanations).

To test the efficiency of the minimax-BRG on specific Petri net benchmarks, one can call the function test.m
